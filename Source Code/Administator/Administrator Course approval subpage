        <h4>C++ Programming</h4>
        <p> C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and 
          <br> allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to
          <br> develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. C++ is fun and easy to learn!

        <h4>Object Oriented Programming</h4>
        <p>The course focuses on the understanding and practical mastery of object-oriented concepts such as classes,          
         <br> objects, data abstraction, methods, method overloading, inheritance and polymorphism. Practical applications 
          <br> in the domain of data science and as seen in stacks, queues, lists, and trees will be examined.
          <br> Programming is a paradigm that allows you to write a program by modeling real-world things in terms 
          <br> of class and object.

        <h4>Digital Signal Processing</h4>
        <p> Course starts from the basic concepts of discrete-time signals and proceed to learn how to analyze data via the 
          <br> Fourier transform, how to manipulate data via digital filters and how to convert analog signals into digital.
          <br> The solid theoretical bases are complemented by applied examples in Matlab. Design and lab
          <br> exercises are also significant components of the course.
