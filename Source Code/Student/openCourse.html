          <h4><a href="" class="stretched-link">Course Description: </a></h4>
         <p style="text-align:left; text-justify:inter-word;"> Computer Graphics Design combines technology and art by using computer generated images
             also known as CGI and text to create concepts for publishing and advertising which portray different kinds of messages. 
             Computer graphic designers, editors and animators use technology to manipulate and combine visual elements such as images with sound effects and words to illustrate
             emotions and deliver them clearly to an audience.     </p>

         <h5> Key Skills: Artistic ability, creativity, analytical skills, communication skills, leadership, time-efficiency, computer skills.</h5>
         
         <h4><a href="" class="stretched-link">Course Objectives: </a></h4>
         <p style="text-align:left; text-justify:inter-word;"> This course introduces the basic concepts of Computer Graphics Design by providing the necessary theoretical material
             as well as enough practical applications connected with appropriate software programs which will make the workflow 
            process smoothly. Further on, this course aims to teach students the programming languages needed for the program along with demonstrative scripts 
        and assignments which can be solved both creatively and experimentally. </p>
